# (Teleological?) Equilibrium

Anything that moves is alive. Anything that does not move is dead.

All things that are alive tend towards death.

When a thing that is moving causes a thing that is not moving to move, the first thing transfers some of its life to it.

A thing that is dead can only come to life when a thing that is alive transfers some of its life to it.

The definition of life depends on the scale of observation, since the closer you look the more moving things you see.

The amount of life in the universe is constant.

Near death is the natural state of all things: not absolutel dead, but with as little life as possible.
